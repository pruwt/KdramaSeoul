      <h3>Business Proposal</h3>
      <p>
        Shin Ha-Ri (Kim Se-Jeong) is a single woman and works for a company. She has a male friend and she has held a crush on him for a long time, but she learns that her friend has a girlfriend. Shin Ha-Ri feels sad and decides to meet her friend Jin Young-Seo, who is a daughter of a chaebol family. Jin Young-Seo then asks Shin Ha-Ri to take her place in a blind date and even offers some money for her time. Shin Ha-Ri accepts her friend's offer. She goes out on the blind date as Jin Young-Seo, while having the intention to get rejected by her date. When she sees her blind date, Shin Ha-Ri is dumbfounded. 
        Her blind date is Kang Tae-Moo (Ahn Hyo-Seop). He is the CEO of the company where she works.

        Kang Tae-Moo is the CEO of a company that his grandfather founded. One day, his grandfather informed him of an upcoming blind date that he set up for him. Kang Tae-Moo is a workaholic and he is annoyed that his grandfather sets up blind dates for him. He decides to marry the next woman whom he meets at a blind date, so he won't be disturbed from his work anymore. 
        That woman is Shin Ha-Ri, but pretending to be Jin Young-Seo.

        On the following day, Shin Ha-Ri receives a phone call from Kang Tae-Moo. He asks her to marry him.
